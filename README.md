# Football Leagues 🏈

This is the exercise I got:

1. Open a new gitHub user with moveo’s email and create a new repository with a blank project.

2. Create a minisite that will include:
    - 5 football leagues in tab structure.
    - When opening each tab, we need to show  under this the list of the teams included in that league, with the following
      format: 
        - team logo
        - team name
